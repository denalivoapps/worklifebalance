    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Work-Life Balance ("the app") is a free game-like app provided by Denalivo Apps.
        The app aims to encourage users to design and track daily activities of different life areas for a more balanced momentum between work and life.

        get the full access to current and future online features such as reviewing their achievements
        and progress in Work-Life Balance, inviting friends and competing on the leaderboards,
        backing up user data onto the Google Drive under the registered account, and synchronizing user data for usage across multiple devices.
